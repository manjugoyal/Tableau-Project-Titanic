# Tableau-Project-Titanic
This project was done as a part of data analysis nanodegree a Udacity. The intent of the project is to do an analysis 
for data on Titanic and how many people survived. The entire analysis was done in Python 3 using Jupyter notebook and then data 
was visualised using tableau. A story was created and the report generated as a pdf file is attached. The link to tableau story
is in pdf file

#Data
